### Basic (20%)

- [X] [const](./cpp/const.md)
- [X] [new & delete](./cpp/new_delete.md)
- [X] [inline function](./cpp/inlineFunction.md)
- [X] [overloaded function](./cpp/overloadedFunction.md)
- [X] [default arguments](./cpp/defaultArguments.md)
- [X] [reference &](./cpp/Reference.md)
- [X] [pointer.md](./cpp/pointer.md) :hot_pepper:
    - [ ] **review**: pass by value VS pass by reference
    - [ ] **review**: return by value VS return by reference
- [X] [pointer to function](./cpp/pointerToFunction.md)
- [ ] [bit operator](./cpp/bit.md)

### Object Oriented Programming (50%)

#### Object Based: design one class only

##### class without pointer member

- [X] [class](./cpp/class.md)
- [X] [constructor and initialization list](./cpp/constructor.md) 
- [ ]  **design pattern** : singleton (0.5h)
- [ ]  [const member functions](./cpp/constMemberFunction.md)
- [ ]  static member
- [ ]  friend
- [ ]  operator overloading
- [ ]  temp object

##### class with pointer member

- [ ] destructor
- [X] [copy constructor](./cpp/copy_constructor.md)
- [ ] copy assignment operator
- [ ] **review**: rule of three
- [ ] this
- [ ] namespace
- [ ] **review**: constructor review
- [ ] **review**: special member function  https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/


#### Oject Oriented: design the relationship between classes

- [ ] 3 basic relationships: Composition, Delegation and Inheritance
- [ ] **degisn pattern** todo:
- [ ] Polymorphism :star: :hot_pepper:
- [ ] **review**: lifetime of object


### Generic Programming (30%)

#### Template

- [ ] Class templates
- [ ] Function templates

#### STL (standard template library)

- [ ] TODO: string :star:
- [ ] TODO: vector
- [ ] TODO: set
